# Electron Basics

## What Is Electron?

ElectronJS is a framework for making desktop applications with webdev tools - Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a bunch of cool functionality that you wouldn't have on a webapp, like offline functionality, dynamic windows, access to some of your system's tools, and more!

## Requirements

Electron runs on Node, which you can download (here)[https://nodejs.org/en/]. You'll also need a code text editor, I recommend (Brackets)[http://brackets.io/] or (Atom)[https://atom.io/]. Last but not least, you need access to your command line. 

## Step 1: Setting Up Our Project

First, we need to set up a folder to do our project. Open up the terminal, navigate to where you want the project, and type `mkdir my-electron-project` -- or whatever you want to call your project.
